This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Don't forget to update bootstrap's scss, 
bootstrap's main js file in /js/vendor/bootstrap.js, 
bootstrap's glyphicons and font-awesome's font-files in 
/assets/fonts/bootstrap and respectively /assets/fonts/font-awesome folders
and font-awesome's scss to their latest version before starting.

Also do a search and replace all on the files in this template for 
"_mbbasetheme" (without quotes, of course) to your preferred text domain.

To override any of Bootstrap's or Font-Awesome's variables, 
it's enough to copy the variable to partials/_variables.scss and remove the !default from them.
There already are some overrides, feel free to add/remove as needed.

Last, but not least, change the Theme Name, -URI, -Author and description. These also can safely be deleted, except the Theme Name.

_mbbasetheme is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2016 Automattic, Inc.
